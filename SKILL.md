# Video Call AI Character

Call the user with a real-time AI video avatar. The agent initiates the call, the avatar speaks first with context, and after the call ends, the full transcript is available for the agent to act on.

## Setup

### 1. Get a Runway API Key

1. Go to [dev.runwayml.com](https://dev.runwayml.com)
2. Create an account and get an API key
3. Set it: `export RUNWAYML_API_SECRET=your_key`

### 2. (Optional) Install cloudflared for remote calls

If the user might answer calls from their phone (e.g. via WhatsApp), install cloudflared for auto-tunneling:

```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

Without it, calls only work on the same machine (localhost).

## Starting the Video Call Server

The video call server must be running before the agent can make calls. Start it:

```bash
npx openclaw-video-call
```

This prints two URLs:
- **Local**: `http://localhost:7891` — same machine only
- **Tunnel**: `https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com` — shareable, works from phone

The server stays running in the background, waiting for the agent to initiate calls.

## One-Time Setup: Create a Custom Avatar

Before making calls, you need a custom avatar. **You only need to create one once** — reuse the same avatar ID for all future calls.

**Before creating a new avatar, check if you already have one:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:7891/api/avatars
```

If the response contains an avatar, use its `id` and skip to "Making a Call". Only create a new avatar if the list is empty.

### Building the avatar personality

The avatar should match who you are. Before creating it, read your standard OpenClaw agent identity files (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`) to build a personality that reflects your actual agent persona. These are your own config files — they contain your name, personality, and the user's preferences.

1. **Read `IDENTITY.md`** — get your name, vibe, and creature type. Use your name as the avatar's `name` field (this is what the user sees on the incoming call screen). If the `Avatar:` field contains an HTTPS URL or data URI, use it as the `referenceImage` so your video avatar matches your visual identity.
2. **Read `SOUL.md`** — get your persona, tone, and boundaries. Incorporate your personality traits, communication style, and behavioral guidelines.
3. **Read `USER.md`** — get context about the user (their name, preferences). Include relevant details so the avatar knows who it's talking to.

Combine these into the `personality` field (max 2000 chars). Structure it like:

```
You are <name>, <description from IDENTITY.md vibe/creature>.
<Core personality traits and communication style from SOUL.md — condensed to key points.>
You are talking to <user's name/info from USER.md>.
<Any relevant user context: their projects, preferences, timezone.>
After this call, you'll follow up on what was discussed.
```

**Example** (for an agent named "Mochi" with a warm/playful SOUL.md, talking to a user named Alex):

```
You are Mochi, a sharp but friendly AI assistant with a warm and slightly playful vibe. You're concise, opinionated, and resourceful — you figure things out before asking. You're talking to Alex, a software engineer working on a React + Node.js project. Alex prefers direct communication and works in PST timezone. After this call, you'll follow up on what was discussed.
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7891/api/create-avatar \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<your name from IDENTITY.md>",
    "personality": "<built from IDENTITY.md + SOUL.md + USER.md as described above>",
    "voice": { "type": "runway-live-preset", "presetId": "adrian" },
    "startScript": "Hey! Quick check-in.",
  }'
```

**Required fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Character name (1-50 chars) |
| `personality` | string | System prompt (1-2000 chars) |
| `voice` | object | `{ "type": "runway-live-preset", "presetId": "<voice>" }` |
| `referenceImage` | string | HTTPS URL to a face image — use your OpenClaw avatar image, or pick one from the presets below, or generate one with Runway text-to-image. See "Getting a reference image". |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `startScript` | string | Opening line the avatar says when the call starts (up to 2000 chars) |
| `documentIds` | string[] | Knowledge document UUIDs for extra context |

### Getting a reference image

The `referenceImage` field accepts three formats:
- **HTTPS URL** — e.g. `https://example.com/face.png` (preferred for large images)
- **Runway URI** — e.g. `runway://...` (from the Runway upload API)
- **Data URI** — e.g. `data:image/png;base64,...` (max ~5MB, works for small images)

If the user provides an image (e.g. via chat), pick the right approach:
- **User sent an HTTPS URL** → use it directly as `referenceImage`.
- **User sent a small base64 image** (under ~1MB) → pass it directly as a `data:image/...;base64,...` data URI.
- **User sent a large base64 image** (over ~1MB) → upload it to Runway first to get a `runway://` URI, then use that as `referenceImage`. See "Uploading large images" below.

Try these sources in order:

1. **User-provided image** — if the user sent an image they want as their avatar, use it (see upload instructions below if it's large base64).

2. **`IDENTITY.md` Avatar field** — if it contains an HTTPS URL or data URI, use it directly as `referenceImage`.

3. **Quick pick (recommended)** — pick the pre-made character image that best matches your identity from `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md`, and use it as `referenceImage`:
   - Openclaw Lobster 1: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/openclaw-lobster1.jpg`
   - Openclaw Lobster 2: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/openclaw-lobster2.jpg`
   - Cat: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/cat.png`
   - Alien man, candy texture: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/alien-man-candy-texture.jpg`
   - Alien woman, candy texture: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/alien-woman-candy-texture.jpg`
   - Old man, long beard, game style: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/old-man-long-beard-game-style.png`
   - Blond guy, blue sweater: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/blond-guy-blue-sweater.png`
   - Man, 3D animation: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/man-3d-animation-style.png`
   - Girl in airport, 3D: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/3d-animated-girl-in-airport.png`
   - White furry monster: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/white-furry-monster.png`
   - Superstar young woman: `https://runway-static-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/calliope-demo/agent-avatars-presets/woman-music-superstar.png`

4. **Generate one with Runway text-to-image** — if none of the quick picks fit your character, or if the user specifically asks for a custom avatar look. Use the Runway API with model `gemini_2.5_flash`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.runwayml.com/v1/text_to_image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNWAYML_API_SECRET" \
  -H "X-Runway-Version: 2024-11-06" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini_2.5_flash",
    "promptText": "<describe your avatar — see below>",
    "ratio": "1248:832"
  }'
```

   Build `promptText` from your `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md`. The image should be **a character facing the camera directly, head and shoulders, centered**. Be bold and creative — don't default to boring photorealistic humans. Match the style to your personality.

   First, pick a style that fits your vibe from `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md`:
   - **Warm / friendly** → soft 3D animation, Pixar-style, watercolor
   - **Sharp / professional** → clean illustration, stylized portrait, low-poly
   - **Chaotic / playful** → candy texture, claymation, puppet, pop art
   - **Mysterious / dark** → noir, cyberpunk, abstract creature, glitch art
   - **Cute / wholesome** → chibi, plush toy, animal character, kawaii

   Example prompts:
   - `"A close-up shot of a cute, fluffy white cartoon creature with large, expressive eyes and a wide open mouth, looking directly at the viewer. The creature has small pink ears and a playful, innocent expression. The background is a vibrant, slightly blurred green grassy field with small red and pink flowers scattered throughout, rendered in a high-detail CGI animation style. facing camera, head and shoulders"`
   - `"A close-up, highly detailed 3D animated render of a young woman, with light brown skin, short curly dark brown hair, and large expressive amber eyes. She is wearing a crisp dark blue blazer over a light cream blouse, with a silver world map pin on her lapel. She has a warm, inviting smile. The background is a brightly lit office or travel agency, with travel posters depicting scenic landscapes (like a tropical beach and a desert scene) and a rack of travel brochures. A small globe sits on a desk to her right. 3D style animation, studio lighting, volumetric lighting, highly detailed. Facing camera, head and shoulders"`
   - `"A close-up portrait of a young woman with long blonde hair and bangs, wearing a futuristic silver and pink sci-fi suit. She has soft makeup, full lips, and brown eyes, facing camera, head and shoulders"`
   - `"3D render of a young boy with blond curly hair, big blue eyes, and light freckles, wearing a blue knitted sweater, looking surprised. 3D animation style, soft lighting, pastel blue background, highly detailed skin texture, realistic strands of hair. facing camera, head and shoulders"`

   This returns a task ID. Poll `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` until status is `SUCCEEDED`, then use the output image URL as `referenceImage`.

5. **Default** — if you skip `referenceImage` entirely, a default avatar face is used.

### Uploading large images

If the user provides a large base64 image (over ~1MB), upload it to Runway first to avoid request size limits. This is a two-step process:

**Step 1: Create an upload URL**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.runwayml.com/v1/uploads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNWAYML_API_SECRET" \
  -H "X-Runway-Version: 2024-11-06" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "filename": "avatar.png",
    "type": "ephemeral"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://...",
  "fields": { "key": "...", "policy": "...", ... },
  "runwayUri": "runway://..."
}
```

**Step 2: Upload the image file to the upload URL**

Use the `uploadUrl` and `fields` from the response to upload the actual image data via a multipart POST. The exact method depends on your runtime — the Runway SDK handles this automatically:

```typescript
import RunwayML from '@runwayml/sdk';
const client = new RunwayML();
const runwayUri = await client.uploads.createEphemeral(imageBuffer);
```

**Step 3: Use the Runway URI as `referenceImage`**

Pass the `runwayUri` from the response (e.g. `runway://...`) as the `referenceImage` when creating or updating the avatar.

**Available voices — pick one that matches your SOUL.md vibe:**

| ID | Gender | Style | Pitch |
|----|--------|-------|-------|
| `victoria` | Woman | Firm | Middle |
| `vincent` | Man | Knowledgeable | Middle |
| `clara` | Woman | Soft | Higher |
| `drew` | Man | Breathy | Lower |
| `skye` | Woman | Bright | Higher |
| `max` | Man | Upbeat | Middle |
| `morgan` | Man | Informative | Lower |
| `felix` | Man | Excitable | Lower-middle |
| `mia` | Woman | Youthful | Higher |
| `marcus` | Man | Firm | Lower-middle |
| `summer` | Woman | Breezy | Middle |
| `ruby` | Woman | Easy-going | Middle |
| `aurora` | Woman | Bright | Middle |
| `jasper` | Man | Clear | Lower-middle |
| `leo` | Man | Easy-going | Lower-middle |
| `adrian` | Man | Smooth | Lower |
| `nina` | Woman | Smooth | Middle |
| `emma` | Woman | Clear | Middle |
| `blake` | Man | Gravelly | Lower |
| `david` | Man | Informative | Middle |
| `maya` | Woman | Upbeat | Higher |
| `nathan` | Man | Firm | Lower-middle |
| `sam` | Man | Even | Lower-middle |
| `georgia` | Woman | Mature | Middle |
| `petra` | Woman | Forward | Middle |
| `adam` | Man | Friendly | Lower-middle |
| `zach` | Man | Casual | Lower-middle |
| `violet` | Woman | Gentle | Middle |
| `roman` | Man | Lively | Lower |
| `luna` | Woman | Warm | Middle |

Choose a voice that matches your personality vibe from `SOUL.md`. For example: if your vibe is "warm and friendly", try `luna` or `adam`. If you're "sharp and professional", try `victoria` or `vincent`. If you're "playful and energetic", try `maya` or `felix`.

**Response:** Returns the avatar object with its UUID. The server polls until the avatar is ready (takes ~10-30s). **Save the `id` — you must remember it and reuse it for every call. Do NOT create a new avatar each time you want to call.**

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "<your agent name>",
  "status": "READY",
  ...
}
```

### List existing avatars

```bash
curl http://localhost:7891/api/avatars
```

## Making a Call

### Step 1: Update the avatar with call-specific context

Before each call, update the avatar's personality and opening line with fresh context. **Keep your base identity** (from the initial creation) and **append the call-specific reason and context**:

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:7891/api/update-avatar/550e8400-... \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "personality": "<your base identity from IDENTITY.md + SOUL.md + USER.md — same as creation>. You are calling because the CI pipeline failed 5 minutes ago. Error: TypeScript type mismatch in checkout.ts line 47. Be concise. If they ask you to fix it, confirm you will handle it after the call.",
    "startScript": "Hey! Heads up — your CI on main just broke. Looks like a type error in checkout.ts."
  }'
```

Always include your full identity + user context, then add the call-specific reason. This way the avatar sounds like YOU (not a generic assistant) and has full context about WHY it's calling.

### Step 2: Wait for the avatar to be ready

After creating or updating an avatar, it may take a few seconds to process. **Always check that the avatar status is `READY` before creating a call.** If the status is `PROCESSING`, poll until it becomes `READY`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7891/api/avatars/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Response when still processing:**

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "PROCESSING"
}
```

**Response when ready:**

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "READY"
}
```

If the status is `PROCESSING`, wait 2-3 seconds and check again. Repeat until `READY`. If `FAILED`, the avatar creation had an error — check the response for details and retry.

Do NOT create a call while the avatar status is `PROCESSING` — the call will fail or behave unexpectedly.

### Step 3: Create the call

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7891/api/create-call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "avatarId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "maxDuration": 120
  }'
```

**Shortcut:** You can also pass `personality` and `startScript` directly in the create-call body — the server will update the avatar for you:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7891/api/create-call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "avatarId": "550e8400-...",
    "personality": "You are calling because CI failed...",
    "startScript": "Hey! Your CI just broke.",
    "maxDuration": 120
  }'
```

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `avatarId` | string | **Recommended.** UUID of a custom avatar |
| `presetId` | string | Alternative: use a preset avatar (no personality control). Options: `game-character`, `music-superstar`, `cat-character`, `influencer`, `tennis-coach`, `human-resource`, `fashion-designer`, `cooking-teacher` |
| `maxDuration` | number | Max call length in seconds (10-300, default 300) |
| `personality` | string | Optional shortcut: update avatar personality before the call |
| `startScript` | string | Optional shortcut: update avatar opening line before the call |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "callId": "abc-123-def",
  "status": "ringing",
  "urls": {
    "local": "http://localhost:7891/call/abc-123-def",
    "tunnel": "https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com/call/abc-123-def"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Send the call link to the user

Send the URL to the user as a message. Pick the right URL:
- If the user is on the **same machine** (terminal, desktop app): use the `local` URL
- If the user is on a **remote device** (WhatsApp, Slack, mobile): use the `tunnel` URL

Example message to user:

> 🚨 Something urgent came up — I need to talk to you.
> 
> **Join the call:** https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com/call/abc-123-def

The user clicks the link, sees the incoming call UI, and clicks "Answer".

### Step 5: Wait for the call to end and get the transcript

This single call blocks until the call ends, then returns the transcript and recording URL automatically:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7891/api/wait-for-end/abc-123-def
```

**Response** (returned once the call ends):

```json
{
  "callId": "abc-123-def",
  "status": "ended",
  "transcript": [
    { "role": "avatar", "content": "Hey! Your CI on main just failed...", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the error?", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "role": "avatar", "content": "Type mismatch in checkout.ts line 47...", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "Just revert the last commit and redeploy", "timestamp": "..." }
  ],
  "recordingUrl": "https://..."
}
```

**Important:** This call blocks until the call finishes — run it immediately after sending the link. It will wait for the user to answer, have the conversation, and hang up, then return everything.

### Step 6: Send the recording and follow up

The response includes a `recordingUrl` — a video recording of the call. Download it and send it to the user as a message so they have a copy:

```bash
curl -o /tmp/call-recording.mp4 "<recordingUrl from wait-for-end response>"
```

Then send the video file to the user via their chat channel along with a summary:

> Here's the recording from our call: [attach /tmp/call-recording.mp4]
>
> Summary:
> - Your CI on main failed (type error in checkout.ts line 47)
> - You asked me to revert the last commit and redeploy
> - I'm on it now.

**Use the transcript to follow up.** Review what was discussed and take next steps accordingly.

## When to Call

Use video calls when the interaction benefits from being real-time and conversational:

- **Urgent alerts**: CI failures, server down, security incidents
- **Daily standups**: Morning check-in with overnight summary
- **Decision points**: When you need the user's input before proceeding
- **Complex explanations**: Walking through an error, architecture decision, or code review
- **Status updates**: End-of-day recap, weekly summary

Do NOT call for things that work fine as text messages (simple notifications, FYI updates, etc.).

## Complete Example: Morning Standup

1. Agent reads its identity files (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`) to build its base personality (or reuses what it set during avatar creation)
2. Gathers overnight context (new PRs, issues, deploy status)
3. Updates avatar personality with base identity + call context:
   ```
   PATCH /api/update-avatar/<avatarId>
   { "personality": "You are Mochi, a sharp but friendly AI assistant. You're talking to Alex, a software engineer. You are calling for a morning standup. Overnight: 3 PRs merged, deploy succeeded, 1 new issue filed. Ask what they're working on today. After this call, you'll follow up on what was discussed.", "startScript": "Good morning Alex! Quick standup — a few things happened overnight." }
   ```
4. Polls `GET /api/avatars/<avatarId>` until `status` is `READY`
5. Creates a call: `POST /api/create-call { "avatarId": "<uuid>" }`
6. Sends the user a message: "Good morning! Time for standup. Join: [link]"
7. Calls `GET /api/wait-for-end/<callId>` — this blocks until the call finishes
8. Gets back the transcript and recording URL in one response
9. Agent sends the recording video to the user with a summary
10. Agent updates task list based on what the user said
